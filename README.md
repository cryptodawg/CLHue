# CLHue

## What is CLHue?
CLHue is a Python library I wrote that allows a developer to interact with a [Philips Hue](https://www2.meethue.com/en-us) lighting system:
* Turn on/off lights
* Change colors
* Change brightness
* Manage groups of lights (like all lights in the Living Room, for example)

## How did CLHue come about?
I was interested in building something that would let me interact with my Hue lights via a command line (i.e. the command "off all" would turn off all of my lights). I figured it'd be a great way to learn more about how to interact with an API and expand on my Python programming skills.
